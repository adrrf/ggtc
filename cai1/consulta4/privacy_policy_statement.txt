PRIVACY POLICY STATEMENT FOR FLIGHT PRICE QUERIES

At our airline, we take your privacy seriously. When you search for flight prices on our platform, 
we employ advanced privacy-preserving technology to ensure that your search queries remain private 
and are not tracked or monitored.

Our Commitment to Your Privacy:

1. Privacy-Preserving Flight Price Retrieval: When you request the price of a 
   specific flight, our system uses an Information-Theoretic Private Information Retrieval (IT-PIR) 
   protocol. This technology mathematically guarantees that our servers cannot determine which 
   flight you are interested in.

2. No Query Tracking: Our servers only process encrypted queries and cannot 
   determine the specific flights you are searching for. This means we cannot build a profile of 
   your travel interests or preferences based on your price queries.

3. Data Minimization: We only share the minimum information necessary for you 
   to complete your intended task. When retrieving flight prices, no personally identifiable 
   information is linked to your queries.

4. Multi-Server Security: Our price retrieval system utilizes multiple independent 
   servers that process different parts of your query. As long as these servers do not collude, 
   the privacy of your query is mathematically guaranteed.

We use your flight search data solely for the purpose of providing you with accurate pricing 
information and do not retain, analyze, or share information about specific flight prices you 
have requested.

This privacy-preserving approach represents our commitment to respecting your privacy while 
delivering the flight information you need.
